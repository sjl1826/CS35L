Q1. The patch improves the performance of
"ls"
by making it work as intended and the
"-aA"
more intuitive if a is applied.
Furthermore since the patch removes a check for an error,
the performance of ls before the patch is slightly slower.

Q2. If my company adopts this patched version of Coreutils
instead of the default one, and I wanted behavior for -a
to override -A, I would run into a problem. Furthermore,
scripts that use ls -aA would now have to account
for the change and must be modified.

Q3. If randline.py is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null,
we receive an error "list index out of range".
It attempts to read a line of an empty file and
attempts to access something that does not exist.

Q4. When this script is invoked with Python3,
I get the following error:
"except IOError as (errno, strerror):".
Python 2 exceptions are iterable whereas it can not
be done in Python 3. Therefore the syntax is invalid.
