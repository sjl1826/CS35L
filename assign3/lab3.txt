Lab 3 Log

I first downloaded the source file using the command:
"wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz".

I then used the command:
"tar -xJf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz"
to extract the contents of the .xz file.

I used the command:
"wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig"
to get the signature.

I used the command:
"wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg"
to grab the keyring.


Afterwards, I ran the command:
"gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig".
I got this error:
"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!".
I believe that I received this error because my key needs to be certified
in order to pass the warning.

I then went into the coreutils-8.29 directory.
I used the command:
"emacs INSTALL"
to look at how to install the package.

I ran the commands:
./configure
make
make install

The install didn't work.
I got an error attempting to enter the directory.
It said that the install failed.
I then went into INSTALL to check if I had made any errors.
I used a keyword to retry the install in the correct directory.
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/samuelle/assign3/coreutils-8.29
make
make install

The install worked after setting the prefix to my directory.
I ran the command:
coreutils-8.29/bin/ls -aA
..        cpfactor   ls       pathchk   sha224sum  tac       unlink

basename  df         head     mktemp   ptx       shuf       touch     who
cat       dir        hostid   mv       pwd       sleep      tr        whoami
chcon     dircolors  id       nice     readlink  sort       true      yes
chgrp     dirname    install  nl       realpath  split      truncate
chmod     du         join     nohup    rm        stat       tsort
chown     echo       kill     nproc    rmdir     stdbuf     tty
chroot    env        link     numfmt   runcon    stty       uname
cksum     expand     ln       od       seq       sum        unexpand
which reproduced the bug and showed a "." and a ".." that didn't belong.
I then copied the patch from Bug#30963 Message #10.
I pasted the patch into my file patch.diff.
I ran the command:
patch -p1 < patch.dff
and it patched up the bug.
I then ran the command "make" and tested "test/coreutils-8.29/bin/ls -aA".
This was my output:
[         csplit     false    md5sum   pinky      sha256sum  tail      uptime
b2sum     cut        fmt      mkdir    pr         sha384sum  tee       users

basename  df         head     mktemp   ptx        shuf       touch     who
cat       dir        hostid   mv       pwd        sleep      tr        whoami
chcon     dircolors  id       nice     readlink   sort       true      yes
chgrp     dirname    install  nl       realpath   split      truncate
chmod     du         join     nohup    rm         stat       tsort
chown     echo       kill     nproc    rmdir      stdbuf     tty
chroot    env        link     numfmt   runcon     stty       uname
cksum     expand     ln       od       seq        sum        unexpand
comm      expr       logname  paste    sha1sum    sync       uniq
cp        factor     ls       pathchk  sha224sum  tac        unlink
I had to use the command:
autoreconf --force --install
to reconfigure for the make
and then "make" without re-installing make.
