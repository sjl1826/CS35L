I first went into the diffutils directory and checked out version 3.0 and made a branch.

git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then installed my change into this new branch by running the patch command.

patch -p1 < ~/assign9/quote-3.0-patch.txt

OUTPUT:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c


I then used the emacs function to create a changelog.
        * src/cmp.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes
        * src/util.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes
        * src/dir.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes
        * src/sdiff.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes
        * src/diff3.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes
        * src/diff.c: changed the back ticks to apostrophes

I then used the following commands to add the ChangeLog and commit it.

git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

I then used the following command to generate a file formatted-patch.txt.

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I then sent my formatted-patch.txt to Shirly, my partner.

I switched to a different branch, partner.

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

I then did git am < ~/assign9/partner-patch.txt
OUTPUT:
Applying: 2018-12-04 Shirly Fang <shirly@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu>

To verify that my ChangeLog entry works, I ran the following commands.

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
make distdir

I then went back to my branch and checked to see if my ChangeLog worked.

cd diffutils*
emacs ChangeLog

It has all of my partners ChangeLog commit that I just added, showing that it worked.

I then went into the GNU Emacs git repository's master branch.

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

Then I ran "gitk".

I got the following error:
Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.7" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)

I had to reinstall XQuartz and then it worked. I found the newest merge and took a screenshot.

I exited and then did the following commands:

ssh -Y samuelle@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk
