1. If other teams really had been observing all the bytes going across the network,
my network is still secure. It is still secure because the messages are encrypted
with the public key and are decrypted with the private key, which the other teams do not know.
If I assumed the other teams had also tapped our keyboards after completing the
client-server setup and had thereby obtained my team's keystrokes during later operation,
it would still be secure because they would not know the private key.
If I were booting off USB and the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB,
it would not be secure because if they had physical control of the USB temporarily,
they could access the private key from the USB data.

2. The gpg2 --verify command in the following instructions doesn't really verify that
you personally created the file in question because it checks the signature once decrypted
instead of checking the user that created the file.
This could be a problem if the file is intercepted, changed, and sent without the
authentication of knowing the original sender.

This problem can be fixed by incorporating a database program into the transaction to
monitor the transaction and check for the user who created the file and keep track of the file securely.
